# dotfiles

Here are my dotfiles, I'll add some more options on installation but until then,
running ./install.sh forcibly creates links (and overwriting current dotfiles)
to everything in this directory and puts them in the correct location.

You can also install also pick what you want/don't want by editing install.sh
directly.

~/.vimrc should be used for simple local changes while the directories in .vim should
be used for bigger more permanent changes across different machines
